Now the Rick Roll is a widely spead and widely loved meme, often being reffered to as one of the clasics of meme colture, and it's cuurent usage is often subversion of expectation. The idea being that a person will be watching a video and suddenly the video will switch to Rick Astly dancing as the instrumental of the song begins to play.
